        "preparation": "1. In a large colander, grate the potatoes and onion coarsely, alternating between the two. Squeeze the mixture to remove as much liquid as possible and place it in a large bowl. Add the egg, flour, salt, and pepper, and mix.\n\n2. Pour enough vegetable oil into a large skillet to cover the wall to a height of about 1/2 inch (1 cm) and heat over medium heat. Using a spoon, put about 1/4 cup (60 ml) of the potato mixture for each cake. Gently press the cakes with a fork to flatten them (leaving a space of about 1 inch/2.5 cm between each one). Cook for 5 to 6 minutes or until the cakes are golden brown and the edges are crispy (flip them halfway through cooking). Drain on a plate lined with paper towels. Cook the rest of the potato mixture in the same way.\n\n(You can prepare the cakes in advance, place them on a rack, cover them with paper towels, and let them cool. They will keep for up to 2 hours at room temperature. To reheat, remove the paper towels, place the rack on a baking sheet, and bake at 350°F/180°C for 10 minutes or until heated through.)",
